==================
Feature Enhancement:

* [BUG #23](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/23):
Simplified the regex for floats.
* [BUG #19](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/19):
Printing "wide" datasets with more columns than space in the terminal resulted in a poor viewer experience. This fix removes extra column from the print and mentions the extra columns in the footer.
